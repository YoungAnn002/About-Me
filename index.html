<h2 class="Haiku">A Haiku I Wrote</h2>
<p class="Haiku">
    This is how I feel when I imagine summer:<br>
    <i>The sun shined brightly</i><br>
    <i>I felt the warmth on my face</i><br>
    <i>I bathed in color</i><br>
</p>
<h2>Personal Interests</h2>
<p>
    I have a lot of different interests, one of them being that
    I really enjoy playing the trumpet. I played the trumpet for
    about 7 years, from 5th grade to 12th grade. I don't really play
    anymore because I'm more interested in other things and I don't
    really have time to play. I used to be pretty good though.
</p>
<p>
    I also really enjoy animating. I used to be a lot more into it but
    I decided that it's not what I wanted to do but I still have fun
    bringing those stories to life. I've made a music video and a 
    few other fun short videos. I just liked being able to create a 
    story and create a way for others to enjoy my imagination come to
    life.
</p>
<p>
    Lastly something I really enjoy doing is programming. I mean if I
    didn't I wouldn't be here right? I think it's fun to be able to 
    problem solve and search for answers to problems. It can be annoying
    but I still enjoy it no matter what gets thrown at me because it's
    so rewarding to really figure out something that needed to be figured
    out. I don't enjoy debugging at all but I think it's fun creating a 
    working solution to a problem.
